## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
**This is where you talk about your project!**

Didn't do much over the break but some of the last stuff that I worked on was further experimenting with the type of shape I wanted to use to get the curves. Here I'm using bezierVertex(); I'm pretty happ with how easy this one is to use so I did further experiennts with an eye shape. I like how dramatic they look so I think I'll continue to use bezierVertex() for most (if not all) of the facial features.
