## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
**This is where you talk about your project!**

Little experiment with Conditional Randomness. I just used a random variable to dictate the values of my facial features, e.g. variable < 50, all facial feature values = 0. I don't know if I'll use this one; I think I already have enough of the required parameters (1 discrete, 2 continuous), but if I do I think I'll do at least 2 conditional faces.
