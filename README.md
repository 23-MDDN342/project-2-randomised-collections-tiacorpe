## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
**This is where you talk about your project!**

Adjusted the brown colour palette slightly and added another shade to the mix. I also managed to fix the bugs with the colour and all the sliders. I realised it was because I was declaring the values (in map()'s) several times across the documents - all I had to do in my code was adjust it so the variabel used was = to the value. That seemed to do the trick.

I added a tilt value in as well because I found the grid arrangement was looking quite boring. Though it's limited to -20, 20 so it doesn't overlap with any of the surrounding faces. Besides this I further cleaned up my code, and took out more of the example code that was already present.
