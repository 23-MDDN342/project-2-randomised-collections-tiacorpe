## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
**This is where you talk about your project!**

Did further work on the facial elements including the eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth. The nose, at this stage, will remain the same throughout and I plan to make at least 4 variations of the other facial elements. Additionally, 4 variations of the mask colour as well - I may also add a two-tone colour to the face but I'm not sure if each side of colour would change independently or not. Other tasks I completed:
- Adjusted coordinates so the mask is within the bounds of the target area.
- Edited slider settings (very little).

Am a little behind but otherwise trucking along steadily.
