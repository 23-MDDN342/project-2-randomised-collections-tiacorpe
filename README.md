## 2023 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections
**This is where you talk about your project!**

Final README:
This is the final product of my project 2 work. It has a number of continuous parameters that can be adjusted via the sliders, and controls a good amount of the facial deatures (the only constant is the face shape, nose, & chin) - with parameters also effecting others.

The randomised section of this code is set up in a 5 x 3 grid/display, with a time & mouse click triggering the random change. In this section I also make use of Weighted Selection for the random colour change of the face masks itsself. Overall I'm really happy with how this turned out. I think the facial features look really good, and I'm happy that everything is working pretty smoothly.
